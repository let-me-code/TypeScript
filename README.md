# TypeScript

1. Install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/

2. After installing nodejs , install typescript
npm install -g typescript

###### As typescript is not supported by browser , we have to use typescript (tsc) compiler to compile the typescript file to javascript.

3. Run the compiler in Watch mode.
tsc <filename>.ts -w
  
4. It will make a javascript file with the same name as typescript file name. 

5. Javascript file can be integrated with the browsers.
